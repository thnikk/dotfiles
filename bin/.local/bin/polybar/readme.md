# Polybar Scripts
A lot of these scripts are rewritten versions of internal scripts that I didn't like for one reason or another. Some may not requre a rewrite and all are probably less efficient, but it's been a good learning process and I prefer how they all funciton in the end.

## battery.sh
A simplified version of the battery-combined script

## df.sh
Shows all mounted drives and the percentage of their capacity used

## net.sh
Shows local IP and SSID if connected to wifi

## weather.sh
Pulls weather info from wttr.in and converts emoji weather to material icon

## hwmon.sh
Returns temp or fan speed for given hwmon device name

## time.sh
Tells both shorthand time and date with material icons

## kb.sh
When used in conjunction with ibus and anthy, returns the current keyboard language.
